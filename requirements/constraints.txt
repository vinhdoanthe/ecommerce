# Version constraints for pip-installation.
#
# This file doesn't install any packages. It specifies version constraints
# that will be applied if a package is needed.
#
# When pinning something here, please provide an explanation of why.  Ideally,
# link to other information that will help people in the future to remove the
# pin when possible.  Writing an issue against the offending project and
# linking to it here is good.

# Tests failing in test_cybersouce.py on version 0.0.23
# cybersource-rest-client-python==0.0.21

# Django 3.2 support is added in version 2.2 so pinning it to 2.2
django-oscar==2.2

# Pinned because transifex-client==0.13.6 pins it
urllib3>=1.24.2,<2.0.0

# Was causing some tox issues locally.
virtualenv==16.7.9

# greater versions failing with extract-translations step.
tox==3.14.6
pluggy<1.0.0  # pluggy==1.0.0 requires tox>3.14.6

# TODO : Pinning this until we are sure there aren't any breaking changes, then we'll upgrade.
celery<5.0.0

# bok-choy 2.0.1 still requires selenium<4
# (bok-choy is now deprecated; updates unlikely)
# - pytest-selenium v3 has inconsistent pytest dependency requirements
#   (see pytest-selenium/issues/294)
# - pytest-variables v3 uses pytest.stash instead of _variables. This
#   conflicts with how pytest-selenium uses variables prior to v3.
selenium<4.0.0
pytest-selenium<3.0.0
pytest-variables<3.0.0

# pylint>2.12.2 requires a lot of quality fixes. Can be resolved later on.
